* **user**: 👥 Contains the pages and components that make up the user panel.
* **admin**: 👮 Contains the pages and components that make up the admin panel.

The user panel allows users to view and manage PGs. To access the user panel, users can log in with their credentials. Once logged in, users can:

* View a list of PGs
* Search for PGs
* View details about each PG
* Book a PG


**Admin Panel**
-------------

The admin panel allows administrators to manage PGs and user accounts. To access the admin panel, administrators can log in with their credentials. Once logged in, administrators can:

**Accessing the Admin Panel**
---------------------

To access the admin panel, visitors can navigate to http://localhost:3000/pages/admin in their web browser. This will display the admin login page, where administrators can enter their credentials to access the admin panel.

**Multi-Form Submission**
---------------------

The project includes a multi-form submission feature that allows administrators to enter detailed information about each PG. The form includes fields for:

* PG name

Once the form is submitted, the information is stored in a database and displayed on the PG details page.
